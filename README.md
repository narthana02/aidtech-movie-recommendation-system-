# TASK 2: 

# Movie Recommendation System

Create a machine learning model that can recommend movies to users based on their preferences.

# Steps to create the project:

Load the MovieLens dataset into your Python environment. You can use a library like Pandas to load the dataset.

Pre-process the dataset by cleaning the data, removing duplicates and missing values, and converting the data into a matrix format.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Implement a collaborative filtering algorithm to train your model. Collaborative filtering is a technique that recommends movies to users based on their ratings and the ratings of similar users.

Train your model using the training set.

Evaluate your model's performance on the testing set using metrics like Mean Absolute Error or Root Mean Squared Error.

Use your model to make movie recommendations for users based on their preferences.

Test your model by inputting new user ratings to see the recommended movies.
